making analytics and reporting difficult.

## Architecture
FHIR API → Extract → Transform → Load → Data Warehouse

## Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pipelines/extract_fhir.py

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Engineering
- Healthcare Data (FHIR)
- ETL Design
- Data Modeling
- CI/CD Ready
